#### Description: Data science project in the context of T20 cricket

The aim of this project was to a) conduct some data analysis related to cricket and b) present the results in a website.

**Data analysis

I used Python and SQL to conduct the data analysis. We used a large dataset on cricket matches in the form of JSON files, read those into a SQL database we created, and then used Python to query the database and conduct the analysis. We used external libraries including pandas and matplotlib to help with running and plotting the regression analysis.

**Website

The website was built using the Flask framework in Python. This of course involved HTML and CSS as well, and I used some small amount of JS for a couple of the dynamic elements of the website. The trickiest part of the website was building a bowler comparison tool where users can compare side-by-side bowlers and their statistics. This part required querying a SQL database of bowlers, using Python to handle errors, and JS to dynamically update the website.
